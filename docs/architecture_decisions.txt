I have chosen below 3 message passing techniques to use:
1) REST
2) gRPC
3) Kafka

1) REST:
=========
It's the most straightforward message passing technique. It's choosen for all 
integration from browser to backend in order not to introduce complexity as It's not 
expected to recieve huge amount of requests from the Web Application.

2) gRPC:
=========
Used for integration from Mobile Application to backend. It's expected that the Location 
Service will have a very high load as it continously record the users locations, so gRPC 
will provide the most efficient performance.

3) Kafka:
==========
Used to enable fault tolerance and asyncrohonus processing during storing the location data. 
It's expected to recieve a huge number of requests, so to avoid overloading the location 
service with requests and enhance the performance, Kafka is introduced as buffering technique 
between API layer and Database.
